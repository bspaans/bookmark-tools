Installation of btools is easy. Just run the command:

   sudo python setup.py install

..and everything will be taken care of. You have to restart any open shells to
make use of the cdbm, cpbm, etc. commands, since they are implemented as shell
functions (alternatively you could source /usr/share/bm/bm.bash yourself).
