Installation of btools is easy. Just run the command:

   sudo python setup.py install

..and everything will be taken care of. On UNIX like platforms you'll only have 
to restart any open shells to make use of the cdbm, cpbm, etc. commands, since 
they are implemented as shell functions (alternatively you could source 
/usr/share/bm/bm.bash yourself).

On Windows you might have to restart your session (ie. log out and log in), to 
signal the update to the PATH value in your registry.
