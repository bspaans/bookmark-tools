    Trouble-shooting

    # bash: cdbm: command not found

    First of all; make sure you have restarted your shell since installation.
    Most of the commands will be installed in /usr/bin. Others are implemented
    via shell functions and need to be sourced before they can be used. 
    This is handled automatically by the setup script, which adds a source
    directive to /etc/bash.bashrc which should make the functions available in
    every login shell. This does mean you have to restart to make full use
    of the tools.

    When the cdbm command still can't be found, it's safe to assume that
    /etc/bash.bashrc is not loaded by default on your platform. To work around
    this issue you can source /usr/share/bm/bm.bash in your own ~/.bashrc file
    by adding the line:

        source /usr/share/bm.bash
