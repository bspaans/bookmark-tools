    F.A.Q.


    *** Where can I find out more about using the tools?

    The man pages contain information on the options and arguments each 
    of the tools accept. You can also browse these documents 
    on-line, which might be more pleasant: http://www.bookmark-tools.com/
    Other, more in-depth tutorials and tips are also available on that website.


    *** Can I use this with zsh?

    Yes, all the tools and shell functions are completely functional and tab 
    completion is also provided (You'll need to copy the _bm file in data/ 
    to somewhere in your $fpath to enable it)


    *** Can I use this with Windows?

    The tools were originally developed on Linux, but support for Windows is
    growing. Most of the programs will work, but some shell specific functions
    and help files may be missing. All files will be installed to 
    %PROGRAMFILES%\btools and the bin directory will be added to the PATH.


    *** Is there a source repository I could follow?

    Certainly, there is a git repository which you can clone with the following
    command: `git clone git://www.bookmark-tools.com/btools.git btools`
    It's also browsable on-line. See http://www.bookmark-tools.com/git/

    Trouble-shooting

    *** bash: cdbm: command not found

    First of all; make sure you have restarted your shell since installation.
    Most of the commands will be installed in /usr/bin. Others are implemented
    via shell functions and need to be sourced before they can be used. 
    This is handled automatically by the setup script, which adds a source
    directive to /etc/bash.bashrc which should make the functions available in
    every login shell. This does mean you have to restart to make full use
    of the tools.

    When the cdbm command still can't be found, it's safe to assume that
    /etc/bash.bashrc is not loaded by default on your platform. To work around
    this issue you can source /usr/share/bm/bm.bash in your own ~/.bashrc file
    (or equivalent) by adding the line:

        source /usr/share/bm/bm.bash

    

    *** cmd.exe: 'cdbm' is not recognized as an internal or external command, 
                 operable program or batch file.

    This is an issue with your PATH. The path value is automatically updated
    in your registry on installation, but sometimes the new value won't be
    signaled to your current session. You may need to logout and login again. 



    *** cmd.exe: 'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, 
                 operable program or batch file.
    
    If you get this when running eg. cdbm, it means that the directory that 
    holds the Python executable is not in your %PATH%. You can add it by editing
    the registry, using the setx command, or with by using the non-permanent
        path=%PATH%;c:\Python2.6
