#   matches
#
#   format:
#          BOOKMARK matches expression EXPRESSION [WEIGHT]
#          BOOKMARK matches extensions EXTENSIONS [WEIGHT]
#          BOOKMARK matches itself [WEIGHT]
#          BOOKMARK matches regex REGEX [WEIGHT]
#          BOOKMARK matches sentence WORDS [WEIGHT]
#          BOOKMARK matches filesize OPERATOR FLOAT FILESUFFIX
#          BOOKMARK matches time OPERATOR FLOAT TIMESUFFIX
#         
#   where: 
#          
#          BOOKMARK:      Can be a bookmark from the bookmark index or a directory
#          WEIGHT:        (weight = FLOAT)
#          EXPRESSION:    A shell expression. Following UNIX design: 
#                         a return code of 0 means a match.
#          EXTENSIONS:    file extension separated by spaces 
#                         (starting dots and trailing commas will be ignored)
#          OPERATOR:      ==, <=, <, >, >=, !=
#          FILESUFFIX:    k, m, g, t, p
#          TIMESUFFIX:    years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds
#
#  Rule qualifiers (expression, extensions, itself, etc.) don't have to be typed 
#  out exactly. Like bookmarks they are matched on prefix.
